### Binomial Distrubution
Assumptions - exactly 2 expected outcome; independent events; indentical distribution (p is the same for all)
p_hat = x/N (estimated probability)
If p_hat*p > 5 & p_hat*(1-p) > 5, then we can assume normal distribution
For a binomial distribution defined as the total number of successes: mean is n*p and standard deviation is sqrt(n*p*(1-p))
For the fraction or proportion of successes: mean is n*p and standard deviation is sqrt(p*(1-p)/n)
