Assumptions - 
1) exactly 2 expected outcome; 
2) independent events; 
3) indentical distribution (p is the same for all)

p_hat = x/N (estimated probability)

If p_hat*p > 5 & p_hat*(1-p) > 5, then we can assume normal distribution

For a binomial distribution defined as the total number of successes: mean is n*p and standard deviation is sqrt(n*p*(1-p))

For the fraction or proportion of successes: mean is n*p and standard deviation is sqrt(p*(1-p)/n)
